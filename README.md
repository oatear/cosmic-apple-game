## Story

<i>Years ago a television broadcast was emitted of a particularly tasty apple cider brand. The producers of the commercial celebrated that they had outdone themselves. Immediately after the broadcast, an entity from outer space appeared on Earth. The entity yielded imense power and consumed all of the world's apple cider supply. The entity was unsatisfied with any of the apple cider the world had produced and so 
it began mutating apples at an unnatural rate and squeezing them into new forms of cider. This foreign visitor became known as the Cosmic Apple. You must seek it out and be the first to know the answer to the ultimate question: "what is the universe's tastiest cider?"</i>

## Setup

1. Shuffle all cards together except the `Cosmic Apple` to form the deck.
2. Split the deck in half and shuffle the `Cosmic Apple` into the lower half.
3. Each player draws two cards (Ignore any 'when drawn' effects).

  - Draw a card from the deck.
